# Reducing work without changing face-integral decisions

This change retains the integration densities, quadrature nodes, operation order,
initial cuts, error criteria, depth limit and kink budget. It does not infer failure
from elapsed time, face size, spline degree or a large parent-panel error.

## Reusing work

`face_moments` stores its complete result in the immutable part's face cache, including
`None`; all moment components are retained. A transformed part starts with fresh
geometry caches, and sense repairs also replace the face caches. The mass
cache introduced by the existing shared moment/mass integration retains its own rule.

An adaptive panel requests kink locations only if there is a refinement floor, its
depth is below `MAX_DEPTH`, and its interval still has kink budget. Otherwise the
location cannot affect the next step. All quadrature nodes and the walking state are
still evaluated. The discarded corner search has local state, cannot change the walk,
and does not propagate its projection failures. The initial boundary cuts are untouched.

## A certificate for an inevitable refusal

This is a proof about the existing finite algorithm, not a proof that the geometric
area or moments do not exist, or that a different integrator could not compute them.
Gauss--Kronrod differences are numerical error estimates, not rigorous bounds on the
true integration error.

For one requested density, the coarse pass fixes
`F = 1e-11 * sum(coarse term magnitudes)`. It is not recomputed during refinement.
For an accepted leaf with estimated error `e` and magnitude `s`, the original
adaptive walk updates its unresolved excess as follows:

```
if !(e <= max(1e-9 * s, 0)):
    E = max(E, e)
```

`E` starts at zero. Boundary aggregation also takes a maximum, and the caller rejects
the refined loop when `E > F`. The face does not proceed to loop orientation or publish
an integral in that case. The mass and moment refinements each use their own fixed `F`.

Suppose an accepted leaf makes `E > F`. Every subsequent maximum is at least this `E`.
Thus either a later evaluation fails (the original returns `None`), or refinement
finishes with excess still greater than `F` (the original also returns `None`).
No continuation can produce a successful face result. The optimized walk may return
that rejected prefix; the boundary propagates it immediately, and the unchanged
caller applies the same rejection. In particular, the canonical mass-refinement
caller still stores its `None` result before returning.

This does not reject a parent that can still be subdivided. With ordinary finite
values, an accepted leaf that fails both the relative criterion and `F` was accepted
only because it reached `MAX_DEPTH`. A large error accepted by the relative criterion
does not enter `E`. Equality with `F` is not refusal. With an infinite or NaN floor the
ordered `E > F` guard cannot trigger. Once it does trigger, Rust's `f64::max` cannot
reduce the non-NaN `E`, even if a later estimate is NaN. Evaluation failures remain
failures; no new numerical answer is invented.

## Verification obligations

The tests compare exhaustive and early walks, including accepted sums and end states,
ascending/descending intervals, a bad parent resolved by subdivision, acceptance by
the relative criterion, adjacent floating-point values around the floor, non-finite
floors and exhaustion of the depth budget. A rejected prefix is explicitly shown to
have an incomplete sum, so callers must check its excess before using that sum.
The existing quadrature and kink-budget tests retain exhaustive mode.

Independent face-area/moment references, placements, existing recognition snapshots,
inventory floors and tolerances remain unchanged. Repeated-moment speedups measure
cache reuse; they are not claims about cold integrations or whole-part recognition.
